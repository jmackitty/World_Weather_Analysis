# World_Weather_Analysis

#Project Summary

The purpose of the World Weather Analysis project is to create an app that plans trips for consumers based on their specific weather preferences.The customer can put in their desired weather conditions and the PlanMyTrip app will provide the cities that meet those criteria to the consumer. Once the consumer decides on a city, the closest operational hotel will be provided. This will help the consumer plan vacations. In addition to weather temperature, the app also provides information on the current weather conditions for the cities.

#Results

Code was created that uses Google Maps APIs as well as the Open Weather Maps APIs to pull relevent weather and coordinates of cities for the consumer. The code works and it can be adjusted to include additional cities, or it be refactored to pull data from a specific country or geographical location.
